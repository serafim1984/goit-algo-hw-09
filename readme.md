Measurements show gready algoritms works faster especially with higher numbers 

in our case:

1.3999990187585354e-05 seconds - gready algorithm
0.013664200087077916 seconds - dynamic algorithm

Gready algoritms not always achive optimal results due to straightforward aproach assuming that highest posible nominal will be always correct choise but it is not always the case
